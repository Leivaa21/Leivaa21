## About me

My life dream as a child was being an inventor. So I growed up to be a software developer focused on fulfilling real needs and bring good alternatives to people in a fully digitalized world.

I also enjoy such things as **Gaming** (_shooters and simracing mostly_) and **Enduro** (I know, they're like sooo far away one from another haha)
</br>

## More than just a developer

I define myself as a _learning enthusiast_, and I love to try new things and learn everything about what I'm doing.
</br>
Not a fullstack but always willing to know a bit more.
</br>
Specialized in **backend** and willing to learn more about devops and QA.
</br>

## Coding related

### Methodologies

As a developer I try to keep my code _as mantainable as possible_ so I try always to keep my code **clean**, _structured_ and `self-documented`, as well as functional.

> "It is not enough for code to work" </br> \- Robert C. Martin

This is why I keep with methodologies like DDD, TDD and Hexagonal Architecture.</br>
I think the methodology always should follow principles and not viceversa, so I always focus on keeping the principles listed before and _use_ these methodologies to archieve them rather than using the methodologies because they're cool.

### Langs

The coding langs were I feel more comfortable are: </br>
![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-FFD43B?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=4B8BBE)
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-orange?style=for-the-badge&logo=java)
![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)
![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/C-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white)
</br>
But I'm open for learning new langs and looking foward to add more to this list.

I love to read books as a way of opening my mindset and learn new things, so this is a list of books that I have readed or I want to read.
